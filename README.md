INF4000 - Analyzing Home Advantage and Away Performance in Football

Overview

This research investigates how home advantage varies across different continents and how playing in a different continent affects the match outcome for the away team. The analysis includes statistical exploration, visualization of win rates over time, and comparisons of home and away performances using various charts.

Requirements

Before running the code, ensure the following R libraries are installed:
	â€¢	dplyr: Data manipulation
	â€¢	zoo: Rolling averages
	â€¢	lubridate: Date processing
	â€¢	ggplot2: Data visualization
	â€¢	reshape2: Data restructuring
	â€¢	scales: Formatting visual outputs

Install the required libraries by running:

install.packages(c("dplyr", "zoo", "lubridate", "ggplot2", "reshape2", "scales"))

How to Run the Code
	1.	Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
	2.	Ensure the dataset (results.csv) is placed in the same directory as the script.
	3.	Open the script in R or RStudio.
	4.	Run the script section by section, following the comments for guidance.

Steps in the Analysis

1. Data Preprocessing
	â€¢	Load the dataset (results.csv) and clean missing data.
	â€¢	Assign each team a continent based on FIFA classifications.
	â€¢	Compute key metrics, such as goal differentials and win rates.

2. Descriptive Analysis
	â€¢	Extract unique teams and assign them a continent.
	â€¢	Compare home vs. away win rates across continents.
	â€¢	Identify historical trends in home advantage.

3. Key Visualizations

The following visualizations help to interpret the trends:
	â€¢	Grouped Bar Chart: Displays home win rates in World Cup qualifiers over time.
	â€¢	Scatter Plot: Highlights strongest home teams based on total matches and win percentage.
	â€¢	Lollipop Chart: Compares away win rates when playing inside vs. outside their continent.
	â€¢	Heatmap: Shows away win rates based on home and away team continents.
	â€¢	Histogram: Displays frequency of intercontinental matches.
	â€¢	Stacked Bar Chart: Examines teams playing in their home continent but not in their home country.

4. Interpretation and Insights
	â€¢	Home advantage varies significantly across continents, with higher win rates in certain regions.
	â€¢	Away teams struggle more when playing outside their continent, reinforcing the geographical impact on performance.
	â€¢	Some teams consistently perform well at home, showing a strong home-field advantage despite the number of matches played.

Expected Outputs

After running the script, you will obtain:
	1.	Data Insights
	â€¢	Processed dataset with assigned continents.
	â€¢	Metrics such as home win rate, away win rate, and goal differentials.
	2.	Visualizations
	â€¢	Comparative home vs. away win rate visualizations.
	â€¢	Analysis of historical trends in home advantage.
	â€¢	Geographic performance disparities for away teams.
	3.	Summary Statistics
	â€¢	Percentage breakdowns of home and away wins.
	â€¢	Rolling averages of home win trends over time.

How to Interpret the Results
	â€¢	Grouped Bar Chart: Shows how home advantage has evolved across different continents over time.
	â€¢	Scatter Plot: Identifies teams with consistently strong home performances.
	â€¢	Lollipop Chart: Demonstrates how playing away in a different continent significantly reduces win rates.
	â€¢	Heatmap: Provides a continent-wise breakdown of away performance challenges.
	â€¢	Stacked Bar Chart: Highlights performance differences between regular home matches and those played in the same continent but not the home country.

Notes
	â€¢	Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly before running the analysis.
	â€¢	Adjust parameters for additional filtering or deeper insights.
	â€¢	Modify visual themes for accessibility improvements.
